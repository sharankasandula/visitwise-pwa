Lets integrate auth into this app. I would like to use firebase's auth for authetication, specifically Google OAuth and Anonymous type authetication methods. Setup such that user needs Auth to access the application and auth credentials are stored appropriately so that when user visits the app after some days they should still have access to the application.
